# Difficulties 
The most difficult part of this development process was visualizing what state is. I worked through this project with a couple of my friends and we more of less helped each other reach the finish line.

Building this application helped me understand ReactJS in a much deeper fashion- however. I would not touch this code again uless paid for it.
